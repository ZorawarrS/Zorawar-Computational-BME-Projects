    "How we came up with this question: From initial analysis of the data set and headers along with our background research, we found that the incidence of the disease simply increases with age. We grew curious on what this could mean about the progression of the disease, since biological changes continue to occur as time goes on, so we focused our analysis on finding the link between the initial onset of symptoms age and how this influences the progression of the disease. There is also a higher prevalence of the disease in women, so we wanted to extend our analysis into the male/female split of the progression of the disease. We then looked through the headers and the data values and grew curious about the cognitive assessments as they relate to cognitive decline rates, focusing in on CASI scores as they were recorded closer to the age of death, potentially providing us with a strong analysis of the cognitive decline rate by age of diagnosis.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevalence & incidence\n",
    "  - There are aboiut 7.2 million Americans that live with Alzheimers. This figure is projected to rise to about 13 million by 2050. The majority of patients affected are 65+. Alzheimer's affects about 10% of all people ages 65 and older. Prevaelnce sharply increases with age. Additionally, Alzheimer's is more prevalent in women compared to men. There are about 500,000-900,000 new caes of alzheimer's that are diagnosed each year. Incidence also increases with age, meaning that older individuals are more likely to be diagnosed with alzheimer's. \n",
    "  - Race and Ethnicity- Alzheimers has been found to affect more people of the races African American & Hispanic\n",
    "* Economic burden\n",
    "  - unpaid dementia caregiving market- 346.6 B in 2023\n",
    "  - Shortages in demetia caregiving as rates of dementia increase\n",
    "  - Total payments estimated in 2024 for 65+ dementia is 360B (healthcare, long term, and hospice services)\n",
    "  - Estimation of total cost projection 321 B from 2022 to 1 trillion by 2050\n",
    "  - [Paragraph Explanation] There is a harsh economic burden that is associated with Alzehemiers. In 2023, the unpaid dementia caregiving market was valued at 346.6 billion dollars. Additionally, there are shortages in dementia caregiving as rates of dementia increase. More workers are needed to support the demand for the rise of disease rate. For patients aged 65 or older that total payments are estimated to be 360 billion. This includes healhcare, long term care, and hospice services. By 2050, it is estimated that the total debt will be 1 trillion. On average, families pay 60,000-100,000 dollars annually for hospital/institutional care. Additionally, there is an economic burden put on the patients because they may be forced to retire early, missing out on income. Alzhemiers disease is one of the most expensive in the world, not only because of expensive treatments and hospital care, but also because patients can be effected for the long term.\n",
    "* Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle)\n",
    "    - The biggest risk factor of Alzheimer's is age. As a person gets older the brain begins to deteriorate, creating a higher chance of developing the disease. Another risk factor of Alzheimers is sex. There are double the amount of women over 65 that have alzheimer's then men. Genetic inheritance is also a risk factor of alzheimer's. This can include familial of risk genes. All three of these factors cannot be changed.\n",
    "    - The risk factors that can be changed include, lifestyle and health conditions. Smoking, drinking alcohol, and not eating a balanced diet all contribute to the development of alzheimer's. Furthermore, keeping mentally and physical active help to prevent the disease. Protection from head injuries may also play a role in helping to prevent alzheimer's. Diseases such as diabetes, stroke, and heart problems can create a higher chance of developing alzheimer's. \n",
    "* Societal determinants\n",
    "    - Rheumatoid Arthritis, Diabetes, Depression, High homocysteine levels, Low folic acid correlations\n",
    "    - 2x higher for people without high school diploma, college graduate correlation lowest rates of alzheimers, lower healthcare access correlates to less regular checkups\n",
    "    - Education level has been linked to societal determinants of Alzheimer's. Lower education level has been linked to a higher chance of developing the disease, possibly because education builds congnitive strength that helps to deter the disease. Access to healthcare impacts the prevalance of the disease because oftentimes, early diagnosis can help to fight the disease. In communities with less access to preventative care, the disease may get to the later stages, making it harder for a patient to recover. A lack of communication with others can also be linked to developing Alzheimers. The environment a patient lives in can have some impact on development of the disease. Exposure to heavy metals by air pollution has been linked to cognitive decline. Black and Hispanic americans have higher rates of Alzheimers but also have less access to quality healthcare. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment occur more often in minority communities.\n",
    "* Symptoms\n",
    "    - Some of the early symptoms of alzheimers include memory loss, espeically for recent events. Also, patients may have a difficult time finding a word or using words correctly. Patient may feel confused of their location of time. Misplacing items frequently and mood swings are also symptoms of alzheimer's. As the disease progresses all of these symptoms get worse and eventually the person has a hard time completing day to day tasks. \n",
    "* Diagnosis\n",
    "    - There are many different ways that alzheimers can be diagnosed and most times it requires a comprehensive evaluation of a patient. For starters, doctors will gather information about cognitive capabilities/deterioration, changes in behavior, and family history of dementia. Additionally, doctors may conduct physical examinations to rule out other causes of cognitive decline, suck as Stroke or Parkinson's. Neurophysical tests are also used to more accuratly determine cognitive ability of a patient. This could include the Mini-Mental State exam or Montreal Congnitive Assesment. Lab tests can also be used to rule out other conditions such as vitamin B12 deficiency or thyroid disorders. Brain imagining scans can further be used to see what the brain looks like, to give a more accurate diagnosis. MRI and CT scans can be used to check for brain shrinkage, strokes, or tumors. PET scans can be used to check for amyloid plaques or tau tangles which are telling signs of AD. Emerging methods to diagnosis AD include different biomarker tests. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests can measure amyloid-beta and tau proteins. Blood tests detect abnormal amyloid or tau levels with increasing accuracy.\n",
    "* Standard of care treatments (& reimbursement)\n",
    "    - In mild to moderate stages of the disease, Cholinesterase inhibitors are used to target the cognitive decline associated with the disease. It targets the nerve cells and improves communication between them. Additionally, Memantine is used to treat the disease in more moderate and severe stages. Memantine regulates glutamine to protect against excitotoxicity (moderate-severe). Aducanumab is a newer disease modifying therapy. It invloves Monoclonal antibodies targeting beta-amyloid plaques and is used to slow down the disease progression not only symptoms of AD.\n",
    "    - Medicare covers costs of most AD patients because they tend to be older adults. It covers Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. For Aducanumab, Medicare coverage is limited. Many perscription drugs are covered by insurance, however, many long term care facilities are payed for out-of-pocket by families. However, Medicaid covers the costs of long term care.\n",
    "* Disease progression & progression\n",
    "    - Alzheimers is a progressive disease that worsens over time. It can begin 10-20 years before any symptoms occur with changes in the brain, such as beta amyloid buildup or tau tangles. As the disease progresses, patients begin to experience mild cognitive impairment. This could include subtle memory issues beyond that of normal aging. The patient can still be independent in their life but they begin to act somewhat different. Next, it progresses to mild AD, where patient experiences memory lapses and could have difficulty planning. They may still be independent, however, they need more help with daily tasks. At the moderate AD stage, patients experience worsening memory loss, have difficulty recognizing people close to them, and have major behavorial changes. At this stage, patients require daily supervision and assistance. At the severe AD stage, patients tend to lose the ablity to eat, walk, talk, no control bladder. They become vulnerable to infections and require full time care.\n",
    "On average, the life expectancy after diagnosis is about 4-8 years, while some are able to live 10-20. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in America, however, most patients die from complications rather than AD itself. The decline of the disease is gradual but relentless.\n",
    "* Continuum of care providers\n",
    "    - In the early stages of AD, primary care physicians give treatment and refer patients to more specialized care. Neurologists can also provide care in the early stages. This could include cognitive testing, and brain imaging to confirm a diagnosis. In moderate stages of AD, patients are taken to outpatient specialists that can monitor symptoms and provide/adjust medications as needed. Also, nurse practitioners can provide follow up care for patients. During this stage physical therapists can also help patients maintain function and independence. Families may also consider adult day programs that provide structured activities and supervision for deteriorating patients. In severe cases, home health care providers can give skilled care directly to the patients home. They can help to give the patient medicine and also provide personal care for the patient. Palliative Care Teams can also help to advance care planning and also focus on symptom management to ensure the most comfort for patients. In the late/end-of-life stages of AD, nursing homes can provide 24 hour care for patients. More specifically, memory care units can help people with dementia specifically. Across all stages of the disease, the care of the family is very important. Oftentimes, AD can be very taxing on the loved ones of the patient and these support groups are important to ensure the highest rate of success. The continuum of care for AD is not linear, families often move back and forth between these providers as needs evolve. Ideally, care is integrated and coordinated to support both the patient and caregiver throughout the disease course.\n",
    "* Biological mechanisms (anatomy, organ physiology, cell & molecular physiology)\n",
    "    - The anatomy of the brain is impacted by AD.\n",
    "    - The Cerebral Cortex is slowly damaged. This is responsible for the memory language and cognition centers.\n",
    "    - The Hippocampus is important for memory formation and it is one of earliest regions that was impacted by AD.\n",
    "    - The amygdala is responsible for emotional processing and behavioral responses. As AD impacts this region patients behavior changes and they begin to act differently than they normally would.\n",
    "    - The brain and nervous system are impacted heavily by AD. AD causes imbalances in neurotransmitters. Acetylcholine (ACh) is decreased which results in memory and learning deficits. Additionally, glutamine signaling is altered which leads to excitotoxicity. A decrease in glucose utilization, also known as hypometabolism, in affected regions occurs. Furthermore, the blood-rain barrier becomes leaky causing the impairment of beta-amyloid clearance.\n",
    "    - In cellular physiology, the Tau protein normally stabilizes microtubules, however in AD, Tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, forming neuro fibrillary tangles inside neurons. This blocks axonal transport and leads to cell death. Amyloid precursor protein is abnormally cleaved by beta-secertase and gamma-secertase. This produces AB42 peptides which are sticky, forming extracellular amyloid plaques. These plaques disrupt cell signaling and trigger inflammation.\n",
    "    - Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to impaired ATP production, resulting in energy deficits.\n",
    "    - Synaptic Failure: loss of dendritic spines and synapses precedes neuron death, usually results in the earliest cognitive symptoms.\n",
    "    - Genetic risk factors also exist. APOE e4 allele reduces the clearance of beta-amyloid.\n",
    "* Clinical Trials/next-gen therapies\n",
    "    - Donanemab - This treatment is already approved and has begun to be put into practice. Donanemab is an IV antibody that helps the immune system remove amyloid plaques in early stages of AD. This is a very promising treatment because in a large trial, people on donanemab declined about 32–35 percent more slowly than the placebo group over 18 months. In 2025 the FDA okayed a gentler dose-titration that aims to cut ARIA (brain-swelling) risk which was a significant side effect. The downside of this is this brain swelling side effect, which is more prevalent in individuals with the APOE4 gene.\n",
    "    - Remternetug - Antibody designed by Lilly that is designed for stronger plaque removal in early AD. This is a promising treatment because multiple Phase 3 studies are underway now. It could offer faster or more complete plaque clearance with dosing designed from prior mAb lessons. If the trials hit, this could be the next approved anti-amyloid. However, it also has similar side effects to Donanemab which could cause brain swelling.\n",
    "    - ACU193 - An antibody that ignores big plaques and instead targets small, soluble amyloid oligomers. These forms are considered by many scientists to be more toxic to synapses. This drug is promising because the Phase 2 trial finished enrollment in 2025. It’s the leading test of a genuinely different amyloid target that might help even when plaques are already present. The results are expected after 2025. \n",
    "    - BIIB080 - An antisense oligonucleotide that lowers production of tau. This treatment is promosing because it’s in Phase 2 with FDA Fast Track. If lowering tau translates to slower decline, this would be the first disease-modifier beyond amyloid, and potentially combinable with amyloid drugs. "

    "*(Describe the data set(s) you will analyze. Cite the source(s) of the data.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* How was the data set aquired?\n",
    "    - This data was aquired by using multiomics, spatial genomics, and reference atlases from BRAIN initiative. Researchers used these to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors. The 84 donors were made up by 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age of death of 88 years.\n",
    "* When was it aquired?\n",
    "    - The data was published on October 14, 2024. \n",
    "* Who was it aquired by?\n",
    "    - The data was aquired by researchers at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington. The main researchers behind the study were Mariano I. Gibitto and Kyle J. Travaglini.\n",
    "* What is the data being used for?\n",
    "    - The data was used to focus in on the different cell types in the brain and their ageing progression at different disease stages, the location and pathology of disease based on cell type, finding new early treatments and diagnosis, etc.\n",
    "* What techniques were used to measure the data?\n",
    "    - quantitative neuropathophysiological measurement system, single nucleus RNA sequencing, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, single-nucleus multiome, and cellularly resolved spatial transcriptomics were used to measure and gather data to populate the dataset.\n",
    "* What units is the data in?\n",
    "    - The data uses multiple units per type of data recorded, with the single nucleus RNA sequencing units as number per 10000 reads, transcriptometrics as counts per spot, neuropathophysiology reads as cell density, etc.\n",
    "* How was the data obtained? (Study design & methodology)\n",
    "    - The SEA-AD project is a large-scale brain atlas study. It was designed as a cross-sectional postmortem study. Researchers collected donated human brain tissue from individuals who had Alzheimer’s disease and from healthy controls. They applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), and other advanced “multi-omics” methods to profile cells. They also combined these molecular data with neuropathological assessments and clinical metadata (like age of onset, cognitive status, etc.).\n",
    "* What subjects was the data obtained from?\n",
    "    - Human brain tissue samples donated from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at varying stages of progression. Also, control individuals without AD pathology. Samples were taken from specific brain regions vulnerable in AD (e.g., entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex).\n",
    "* What physiological/pathological process the data describes:\n",
    "    - The dataset captures how brain cells change at the molecular level during the course of Alzheimer’s. It describes Amyloid-β accumulation and tau pathology. Cell-type–specific gene expression changes linked to disease progression. Synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and cell death pathways that underlie dementia.\n",
    "* Potential bias sources:\n",
    "    - Only people who donated their brains were represented. This can underrepresent certain demographics (age, ethnicity, socioeconomic background). Also, focused on particular brain regions most relevant to AD, so not the whole brain. Additionally, relies on medical history and diagnosis accuracy before death, which may not be uniform.\n",
    "    - This was also not a longitudinal study, making any analysis of the data limited in application. For example, CASI scores and other cognitive assessments could have been provided by interval, with multiple scores over time per patient for additional data verification\n",
    "* Limitations and assumptions in the dataset:\n",
    "    - Since data is from brains after death, we can’t track real-time progression in the same individuals. Also there were sampling limitations such as, number of samples is large compared to past brain atlases, but still small compared to population diversity.\n",
    "    - Assumption of representativeness: Researchers assume that these samples and cell states reflect generalizable AD biology—but brain donation bias (more severe or unusual cases, or mostly certain demographics) could limit that.\n",
    "    - Data integration challenges: Combining transcriptomics, epigenomics, and pathology assumes that different data layers align well across individuals."

    "Let's review this by graph/metric: \n",
    "* 1- Dementia Progression Duration split by sex-\n",
    "    - Our two bars had a noticeable difference, with males having a higher error bar and a larger bar than females (low error bar and lower bar). Our T-statistic and p-value tell us the data is significant, which can be visually supported by the difference in bars. Additionally, in our background research, we have learned there is a clear difference in prevalence of Alzheimers between women and men, with women affected more often. It is reasonable to assume there would also be differences in evaluated metrics by gender for that reason, so the progression of the disease can also be different by gender, with women having a more potentially agressive prognosis. \n",
    "* 2- Age of Symptom Onset vs Dementia Progression Duration- \n",
    "    - Visually, we notice the majority of the patient data points bunched at the 80-90's range (symptom onset age), and a lower overall disease progression in years for these patients. Those values are bunched around the line of best fit. In terms of reasoning, it makes sense that older patients (symptom onset) have a lower duration of the disease since they are already closer to their final years in age, leaving less room for time. We also see the data points more scattered around the line of best fit as the age of onset symptoms is lower, which can make sense as there are also less data points for patients in that age, leaving more variabilty (as supported by our R^2-value).\n",
    "* 3- Age of Symptom Onset vs CASI Score- \n",
    "    - Visually, the data points are scattered all over the plot with no clear trend. This supports the R^2 value of 0.05.\n",
    "* 4- Dementia Progression Duration vs CASI Score- \n",
    "    - Visually, the data points are scattered all over the plot with no clear trend. This supports the R^2 value of 0.02.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Validation of our Data\n",
    "In a study done by Tort-Merino et al. (2022), researchers studied the differences in AD progression of early onset and late onset of AD. By studying a cohort of 195 patients, they found that earlier onset of the disease lead to a more aggressive cognitive decline and typically ended in a quicker death. They also found that the APOE4 gene had a role to play in the development of earlier onset AD which lead to this quicker decline. This was somewhat similar to what we found in our comparision of age of symptom onset and progression. However, our data set was much smaller than the one used by these researchers. We believe that if we had a larger dataset, we would be able to obtain similar results. Furthermore, this dataset was split into two groups, where one was patients under the age of 65 and one was over 65. In our dataset we focused mainly on patients older than 65; while researchers were collecting the data in our set, they weren't focused on this distinction. If we used similar methods, we believe that we would have found similar results. "

    "## Conclusions and Ethical Implications: \n",
    "Through our research we found a low-moderate correlation between age of symptom onset and dementia progression. We obtained an R^2 value of 0.33 for our graph which shows this relationship. Furthermore, we found no correlation between age of symptom onset or dementia progression duration with CASI score. The R^2 value that we obtained for this statistical analysis was 0.05 and 0.02 respectivly. This shows that there wasn't a significant relationship between the intial age of onset compared to dementia progression. \n",

    "    - In the study that we used to validate our work, the researchers found that earlier onset of AD led to a more aggressive disease progression, and typically ended in a sooner death. In these cases it would be important for doctors and caregivers to prepare the family of the patients for this rapid decline. These caregivers should be transparent in what they tell the families, which would give the best chance for families to support the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Need for personalized care pathways​\n",
    "    - In same case, it is also important for doctors to develop personalized care pathways that fight against the more aggressive decline of the earlier onset of disease. This could include stronger medications/therapies that fight against the disease. The opposite is also true, where doctors may develop a lighter care pathway for later onset of AD, so patients experience less side effects and are able to live their last years more comfortably. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adequate Caregiver support ​\n",
    "    - There is a lack of caregiver support in today's society for AD patients. AD develops over many years and care is very expensive for patients and oftentimes they are forced to pay out of pocket because insurance doesn't cover a lot of treatment. Oftentimes, the care that is available is very expensive and can suck the funds out of the family of the patient. In lower socioeconomic regions, care may be impossible to obtain and could lead to the rapid decline of a patient. If care was more readily available, especially in these lower class communities, the survival rate of the disease could be higher. "

    "Future Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deepen Analysis (Include MMSE, MoCA scores)​\n",
    "    - In the future, we could deepen our analysis to include MMSE and MoCA scores. In our study we only looked at CASI scores, which give an overall measure of cognitive ability. By using MMSE and MoCA scores (scale all 3 scores to some standard metric), we could truly assess AD severity in the patient. This could help use find more specific results that relate to different stages of AD and how dementia develops in these patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore how APOE genotype and sex interact with age of onset\n",
    "    - Additionally, we could explore the APOE4 allele that is a genetic variation that causes a higher risk of developing AD. By looking at this aspect, we can see how much AD symptoms devleop and how that impacts the progression of dementia in a patient. This gene typically leads to an earlier onset of AD, which could lead to a more aggressive cognitive decline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Curiosity:\n",
    "* After completing this research we are curious about the following quesitons: \n",
    "    - Could resilience factors buffer progression despite an earlier age of onset?\n",
    "    - Why do some early-onset patients decline faster? Is it purely Biology based, or could\n",
    "socioeconomic factors play a role?\n",
    "This research sparked our intrest in these areas and in the future we could pursue more research to find that answers to these. "
